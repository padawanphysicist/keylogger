#+title: Keylogger

With so many event files, how can one possibly know which one corresponds to which? This command is what you need:
#+begin_src sh
cat /proc/bus/input/devices
#+end_src
It will display relevant information about all the input devices connected to your system. Find your keyboard and look for the field =Handlers=.

Then use
#+begin_src sh
sudo LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./ GUILE_LOAD_PATH=./ /home/vct/.local/bin/guile -e main -s keylogger.scm -i /dev/input/event4 -o $(date +"%Y-%m-%d")-keylog.txt
#+end_src
